# 3D Scene Project

## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
In designing software, I start by defining clear goals and understanding the user experience I want to create. I focus on breaking down complex tasks into manageable components and prioritize usability and functionality.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project enhanced my skills in low-polygon modeling and texture application, along with lighting setup to create realistic 3D environments. It also improved my understanding of camera navigation and user interaction within 3D spaces.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process, starting with concept sketches and selecting objects that would form a cohesive scene. I then created low-poly models, applied textures, and refined the lighting. Feedback and testing were integral at each stage to ensure quality.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design approach, focusing on modular development and feedback loops, is applicable in any future project. It allows for flexibility and continuous improvement, ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I approach program development by structuring my code into reusable modules and functions. I emphasize clarity and maintainability, which facilitates future modifications and debugging.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I adopted strategies such as modular coding for object creation and lighting, and the use of custom functions to handle repetitive tasks. This not only streamlined the development process but also made my code more organized.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial in refining models, textures, and lighting. It allowed me to continuously test and improve the scene, ensuring that each element contributed to the overall visual quality and user experience.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my coding approach became more structured and efficient. I learned to anticipate potential issues early on and addressed them through careful planning and modularization.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a foundation for problem-solving and innovation. It equips me with the tools to create complex systems, like 3D visualizations, that can be applied in various fields to enhance user experiences and deliver value.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working with computational graphics has broadened my understanding of visual representation and interaction design. These skills are valuable in advanced studies, particularly in areas like virtual reality and interactive media.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The knowledge gained in creating 3D scenes and visualizations is directly applicable in fields like game development, simulation, and digital media. These skills enhance my ability to contribute to projects that require sophisticated graphical content and user interaction.
